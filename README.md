## What is QA Workflow?

QA means "Quality and Assurance", this doesn't mean if the game is good or not, this says if the things done are well done or not.

So, QA workflow is a step-by-step process on how to perform tasks that "ensure" the quality of the project from the beginning to the end of the task. The workflow can change during the development of the game, because there are different phases and they need to be tested in a different way. 

To reduce errors and minimize bugs, different tools are used to help us carry out our work. The most common are templates that can be easily used by anyone because they are very intuitive. Also, the organization is very important since we have to be constantly in contact with our team and provide quality feedback so that we can polish every feature as much as possible.

## QA process

Here it is the typical QA workflow to make sure everything is running well:

**1. Requirements:** All ideas need to be clearly written down in a format that everybody understands.

**2. Test Strategy:** The goal is to find ways to better test the software but it should make your shareholders and investors feel confident about the product you are about to release. Creating a quality testing strategy is crucial because, once in place, it will be difficult to change. Be sure to go over the requirements documentation once again and single out the most important aspects of the target software’s environment. The “environment” can be defined as a certain operating system or a mobile device.

**3. Test Planning:** The success of the software under test will depend on how well the tests were carried out. If you have all possible variations of platforms that your software will be used in, then your setup is ready to go.

**4. Testing:** When the build is out, you are ready to go hunting for bugs. Follow the software’s navigation path and become as familiar with the software as possible. This will help if you find a bug and you want to find it from the beginning, because you will remember what steps you have done to reach that point where the bug is.

**5. Pre-release:** In order to ensure the highest product quality, rigorously test the software for the following parameters:  
+ Scalability 
+ Performance 
+ Functionality 
+ Platform compatibility 

In most cases, the QA process and procedures occur during a time crunch and there is usually not a lot of time reserved to provide feedback to other team members from the perspective of the end user, but such feedback is extremely important.

**6. Release:** The QA team is responsible for the release and it requires a very organized workflow. Do not start drafting the release document on the day of release, always plan all release activities beforehand. This release documents should include all of your expectation for the software and should include all requirements and their versions. Since every product is unique and has its own set of features, other quality assurance strategies will include some extra steps to make sure all of the features are tested.
